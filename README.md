This project is a full-stack application that integrates a React frontend with an Express backend. The project uses various technologies such as Mongoose, Parse, CORS, and APIs to provide a robust and scalable application.

Technologies Used

Frontend

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Pages: : The landing page of the application. : A page allowing users to choose between different options. : The main layout component. : A page displaying images. : A page about the application or company. : A page showcasing different projects. : A page displaying client information. : A page that describes the process of listing items or services.

: The footer component with contact and other relevant information.
Backend

Express: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to manage data relationships, schema, and validation. Parse: A backend platform that provides tools and services for mobile and web applications. CORS: A middleware allowing for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, enabling secure communication between the front end and back end.

Use Axios or fetch to interact with your Express API routes. Ensure that the front end makes calls to the correct endpoints exposed by your Express server.

Connect to MongoDB by configuring the connection string in your app.js

CORS middleware in your Express server to handle cross-origin requests.
